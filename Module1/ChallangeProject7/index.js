/*
Challenge: Starting from scratch, build and render the 
HTML for our section project. Check the Google slide for 
what you're trying to build.

We'll be adding styling to it later.

Hints:
* The React logo is a file in the project tree, so you can
  access it by using `src="./react-logo.png" in your image
  element
* You can also set the `width` attribute of the image element
  just like in HTML. In the slide, I have it set to 40px
 */

import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"


const page = (
<>
  <h1>Testing</h1>
  <img src="./react-logo.png" width="40" />
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
    <li>Item 4</li>
    <li>Item 18</li>
  </ul>
  </>
)

ReactDOM.render(page, document.getElementById("root"))
